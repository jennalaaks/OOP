Explain the following terms:
a. Abstraction (in programming)
    Abstraction is used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation 
    about the data so that users only see the required information. 
    It is one of the most important and essential features of object-oriented programming. 
    Pre-defined functions are similar to data abstraction.

b. Accessor and mutator methods
        Accessor Method: This method is used to access the state of the object i.e, the data hidden in the object can be accessed from this method.
        Mutator Method: This method is used to mutate/modify the state of an object i.e, it alters the hidden value of the data variable.

c. Public and private methods
    Private methods are those methods that should neither be accessed outside the class nor by any base class. 
    In Python, there is no existence of Private methods that cannot be accessed except inside a class. However, 
    to define a private method prefix the member name with double underscore “__”

    Public members (generally methods declared in a class) are accessible from outside the class. The object of the same class is required to invoke a public method. 
    All members in a Python class are public by default. Any member can be accessed from outside the class environment.


d. __str__ method (in Python)
    The __str__ method in Python represents the class objects as a string – it can be used for classes. 
    The __str__ method should be defined in a way that is easy to read and outputs all the members of the class. 
    This method is also used as a debugging tool when the members of a class need to be checked.
